# Machine-Vision-Based-Automation-of-Wall-Putty-Process
Manual application of putty on walls can introduce bubbles or uneven coating along with there being
chances of leaving out patches of wall. To avoid this, an automated, error-free solution is required to
ensure that the putty is spread evenly on the entire wall.
The project aims to use Machine Vision to automate the process of applying wall putty.
1. The system will analyze the wall surface using cameras and image processing algorithms.
2. It will determine the appropriate amount and location of putty to be applied for increased
accuracy and efficiency.
3. The project will involve research and development of hardware and software and testing and
implementation in real-world setting
4. The ultimate goal is to revolutionize the construction industry by reducing human error and
increasing productivity.
